# Örder self-checker
Örder is not only an awesome order management application, it is also a great self-evaluation, done by our best junior java developers.
The goal is not to "get it over with", the goal is to learn & grow:
 - Do I grasp the concepts?
 - Which topics do I get? Where can I challenge myself to go the extra mile?
 - Where do I struggle? Which topics should I work on?
 - Do codereviews on your own code. Make it work + improve and refine it. (for inspiration, look at https://switchfully.slack.com/files/UK99TQ0G6/F0100872XJA/codereview.pdf)
## Which choices did you make in your project
As a developer you have to make choices constantly.
Choices about time efficiency and quality, choices about your architecture, choices about functionality.
Which choices did you make? (List your choices below, remove what is not relevant)
 - What is your focus when working on Örder?
 > FOCUS ON THE THINGS I UNDERSTOOD
 - Do you have a single-module maven project? Or a multi-module maven project?
 > SINGLE MODULE, FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF KAREL
 - Are you working test-first?
 > UHM...NO. BUT I WROTE 4 TESTS OVERALL!
 - Do you have security enabled?
 > I USED TO HAVE BUT I GAVE UP QUICKLY
 - Do you have logging enabled?
 > I DID PUT IN LOGGING INTO CUSTOMERCONTROLLER, BUT DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT WORKS.
 - What happens if the firstname contains numbers? Is this allowed?
 > IN A STRING, WHY NOT? I TRIED IN POSTMAN, IT STILL WORKS
 - In which currency are the prices?
 > EURO, OBVIOUSLY. BUT I DID NOT ADD THE CURRENCY TO THE PRICE.
 - Does the phonenumber include the country code?
 > IT DOES NOT CHECK IT
 - Did you go for a similar architecture as digibooky?
 > NO, I WENT FOR LESS COMPLICATED.
 - Is your application deployed in the cloud? (Heroku?)
 > NO.

### Comments: 
It seems to be working on Postman with posting an OrderDto, I do not know how to enter the complicated Order/ItemGroup/Item into api.
There was also an issue with "inStock", now it is completely ignored.
Amount of items in stock: how to put it in code? It is not something the customer enters into api - how to deal with it? (Deduct items from existing stock, etc.)
Overall, difficulty to put together all different domains (order, customerId, itemGroup, etc.).
